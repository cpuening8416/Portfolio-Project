## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I Learned a lot about CSS Grids and the CSS Grid Items. It makes design web pages a lot simpler in terms of divs and specific layouts that would require a lot of additional work and sometimes a lot of confusion. A piece of code that I am proud of is displayed below:


```css
.grid-container{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
    'header header header header header header' 
    'left left left right right right'
    'left left left right right right';
 }
```


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Item](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid_item.asp) - This helped me for figuring out understanding how to set up and use CSS grids. I really liked this feature and really look forward to using it again in the future.
